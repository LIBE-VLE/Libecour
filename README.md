This plugin was developed within the virtual learning environment LIBE, which provides inquiry-based learning in key information processing skills for ICT (literacy, numeracy and problem solving). The system is specially designed for low achieving students, who might find it difficult to engage with typical learning environment due to for example, problems in reading comprehension. In order to overcome such difficulties, LIBE is able to provide personalised support or hints to students, by adapting the support message to the individualâ€™s ability, such as their literacy level. The system includes a learner model that entails information about the student (ability level, or literacy level etc.), which is used to generate the support messages. Students are able to view these messages as they wish on demand while working with the learning environment on moodle by clicking on a link that provides a pop-up window, which includes the personalised message.

The developed plugin is able to generate these personalised support messages within moddle quizzes. It includes a learner model that can be initialised through domain specific quizzes and questionnaires. The learner model is then used to provide hints/support to students that are tailored to their specific knowledge, such as their ability level (high, medium, low).
